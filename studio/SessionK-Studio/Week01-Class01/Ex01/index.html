		Not really expecting to going to an art school, I somehow<br>got into Parsons and started my studies since 2018<br> Fall in New York City Manhatten. Living in the city, I<br> missed California a lot in the beginning but now I like<br> the city except for its weather. I am currently in<br>seconder year majoring communication design and hopeflly<br> minor in fine arts so that I can pursue my passion.
