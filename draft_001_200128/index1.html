	<br>EYE<br>
	 would glide over the grey fitted carpet in the narrow,<br>
	 long and high-ceilinged corridor. <br>
	 Three prints, depicting, respectively, <br>
	 the Derby winner Thunderbird,<br>
	 a paddle steamer named Ville-de-Motitereau,<br> and Stephenson lcomotive,<br> 
	would lead to a leather curtain hanging on thick,<br> black,<br>
	grainy wooden rigns.</p>
	<br><br><br><br><br>

	<p>It would be a <br>
		LIVING ROOM<br>
		about twenty three feet long by ten feet wide.<br> On the <br>
		LEFT<br> 
		there would be large sofa upholstered in worn black leather,<br>
		with pale cherrywood bookcases on <br>
		EITHER SIDE<br> 
		heaped with books in untidy piles.<br>
		Then, on the <br>OTHER SIDE<br> 
		of another door,<br> 
		beyond a low,<br> 
		square revolving bookcase suoporting a large,
		<br> cylinderical vase decorated in blue and filled with yellow roses,
		<br> set beneath an oblong mirror in mahogany frame,
		<br> there would be a narrow table with its two benches upholstered in tartan,
		<br> which would bring your 
		<br>EYE<br> 

		</p>
		<br>
		<br>
	<p>
		FIRST DOOR
		<br>would open onto a bedroom
		<br>its floor covered with a light-coloured fitted carpet
		<br>SECOND DOOR
		<br>would reveal a study
		<br>ON A THIRD
		<br>eben smaller table would a Swedish lamp and a typewriter
	</p>
	<p>There<br>
	life would be easy<br>
	SIMPLE</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>All the servitudes,
		<br> all the problems brought by material existene would find a natural solution.
		<br>
		<br>It would be May, 
		<br>the start of a long summer's day.</p>
		<br>

		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		THEY would open the mail<br>
		THEY would open the newspapers<br>
		THEY would light their first cigarette<br>
		THEY would go out.<br>
		THEY would meet for lunch<br>
		THEY wouldn't feel enslaved by them:<br>
		THEY would go off on a chance adventure<br>
		THEY would not know rancour, or bitterness, or envy.<br>
		THEY would call this balance happiness<br>
		<br><br><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		THEIR freedom<br>
		THEIR widsom<br>
		THEIR culture<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<br><br><br><br>
		THEY would know how to retain and to reveal it in every moment of their living,<br>
		<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
